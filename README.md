# JavaScript Learning

This repository contains my solutions for exercises from the [Boot.dev JavaScript course](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-javascript) starting from **Chapter 4 onward**.

The purpose of this repo is to go beyond surface-level understanding and dive deeper into the language by practicing with structured exercises.

---

## Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:

- Strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals through consistent practice.  
- Explore JavaScript concepts in greater depth than surface tutorials.  
- Build a strong foundation for problem solving and future projects.  

---

## Repository Structure

Exercises are organized by **chapter** and **lesson** for clarity. Each folder will contain files with the following format:
```bash
[lesson_number]-[lesson_name].js
```
The code in these files are solutions to the problems with some comments to help me when I come back to them for reference.

## Tools I use 

While [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) is a paid service, all the exercises and lessons are available for free, you just pay for the interaction. 

With this being the case and my limited budget as a college student, I have opted to code and run all the exercises locally using:

-   [neovim](https://neovim.io/) for my text editor
-   [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) for my runtime
-   [ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) for my terminal to run the code

Don't have the time to set all these up and just need to get up and running?
-   [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for all of the above
